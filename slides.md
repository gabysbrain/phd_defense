title: Slicing multi-dimensional spaces
author: Thomas Torsney-Weir
---

## Multi-dimensional spaces?

* Domain areas
* Why visualization?
* Issues of visualization
* Related methods

## Slicing

* What is slicing?
* Advanatages of slicing
* What is missing from HyperSlice?

## Outline of the thesis

1. Motivation
2. 1D slices: Sliceplorer [@Torsney-Weir:2017a]
3. 2D slices: HyperSliceplorer [@Torsney-Weir:2018]
4. Rendering time [@Torsney-Weir:2017]
5. Conclusion

<aside class="notes">

Here is how my thesis was organized and I also list the papers that each 
chapter is based on

</aside>

## Outline for the talk

* Continuous multi-D tasks
* Computing slices
* Projections of slices
* The future

<aside class="notes">

But for the talk, I want to highlight some of the key developments in slicing
that I developed

</aside>

# Continuous multi-D tasks

Section 2.4 of the thesis

# Computing slices

Sections 3.3 and 4.4 of the thesis

* Continuous multi-D tasks
* **Computing slices**
* Projections of slices
* The future

## Dataset types

* Functional description
* Simplical mesh

# Projections of slices

Sections 2.3.3 and 3.3 of the thesis

* Continuous multi-D tasks
* Computing slices
* **Projections of slices**
* The future

## How to choose the focus point?

## Local vs Global view


# The future

Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the thesis


* Continuous multi-D tasks
* Computing slices
* Projections of slices
* **The future**

## Where do we go from here?

# Conclusion

## Outline for the talk

* Multi-D spaces and slices
* Continuous multi-D tasks
* Computing slices
* Projections of slices
* The future

## Thankyou!
